The female bear watches TV sitting on her chair & eating pop corn.She holds a TV control with symbols on it.

When she wants to see a romantic movie she presses the button with the pink cloud,if she desires a horror film she presses the green ghost button, the UFO for science fiction etc.

On TV a green, blind monster vomits his eyes & a rainbow!
Under the girl’s legs there is a pet, a pink bunny with fluffy ears.
The pet has a rainbow cola for body & vomits glitter & eyes!

TV EYE’S PILL symbolizes the pathetic pleasure.
The pink bear sits, eats, watches TV & feels a sweet, pathetic pleasure.
